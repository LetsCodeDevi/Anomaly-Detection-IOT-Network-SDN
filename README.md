Anomaly Detection in IOT Network Using SDN Principles.
A framework for the early detection of anomalies in IOT Network using SDN Principles. The growing trend of IoT has led to important security concerns a
s the number of connected devices increases. This framework allows for centralized control and improved security mechanisms for IoT devices. 
The framework aims to detect anomalies in IoT networks. A prototype is implemented using Mininet to emulate the IoT network, and threat modeling is 
used to identify potential threats.
